# Leaf Notification for Android and Wear

I found Nissan's Android app for the Leaf to be bit cumbersome, and I wanted something that could integrate with Wear. Thus, I reverse engineered the web API endpoints and built this app. Here's a demonstration:

# About the code

The code is available under MIT, feel free to experiment with it, learn from it, etc. It does use an undocumented API that is subject to change, though, and references to Nissan are obviously owned by their respective copyright owner. This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Nissan.

It was a great learning experience, though, and if you have any suggestions, let me know!
